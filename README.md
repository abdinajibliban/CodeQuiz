# Unit 04 Web APIs Homework: Code Quiz

## Description

## MyTask

For this week's assignment I was asked to make a timed quiz using JavaScript Fundatmentals.
I was asked to store the scores so that the person taking the quiz can compare their scores
with their peers. In addition to providing some healthy competition, the ability to view 
one's scores can help the user see their improvements over time. 

## User Guide

Do you want to test your JavaScript knowledge? Take my quiz and find out if you are
a JavaScript Genius!

Begin by pressing the start button. Then answer 5 questions before the countdown clock runs out.
Whenever you get a question correct, your score increases as a reward. Whenever you get a question wrong, your 
time gets deducted as a punishment.

Once you have completed the quiz, you will be given the opportunity to write your name so you can compare yourself 
to your peers.
